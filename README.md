Sky Blue Records Music Store / Ecommerce Site

**Description**
Built a store website using HTML, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for cleaner styling and mobile responsiveness. I began this project wtih regular CSS in mind but decided to change it up and practice using Bootstrap instead. All of application will run locally. The repository includes all of the images and pages needed to run it in a browser. For now I'm relatively satisfied with it, but I'll update more with some aesthetic changes to make it look more polished later on.

The project starts off with a basic homepage. I wanted to keep it simple. Images were stock photos and basic descriptors of the products.

For the shop page I also wanted to keep it minimal. I like the look better, it's less distracting.

The last part of the project is the cart functionality. Where the user can add items to cart and it keeps track of how many and of which items are added. All of this is stored in the browser's memory. I also included a feature that renders the item count in the cart button so the user knows how many items are in their shopping cart at any given time.

I chose a modal component for the shopping cart because I like the separation it gives between the shop page and the user's cart. I also like how it can be in the background if the user needs to add more items or keep browsing.

That's the full description for now. Next update will be making the modal look cleaner and less blocky. I also intend to add product images to the cart in a future update.
