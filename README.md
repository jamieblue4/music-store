**Description**

Built a store website using HTML, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for cleaner styling and mobile responsiveness. I began this project wtih regular CSS in mind but decided to change it up and practice using Bootstrap instead. All of application will run locally. The repository includes all of the images and pages needed to run it in a browser. For now I'm relatively satisfied with it, but I'll update more with some aesthetic changes to make it look more polished later on.

The project starts off with a basic homepage. I wanted to keep it simple. Images were stock photos and basic descriptors of the products.

And for the shop page, there's images of the products, and a counter at the top to show the user how many items are in their cart at any given time.

For easier navigation, I included a drop down menu.

Aside from rendering the cart items in the cart button, there's a checkout feature, add/remove options, and the session refreshes upon "ordering". Ran into a bug during making this project that let quantity go into the negatives, but that's since been resolved and doesn't go below zero.

I chose a modal component for the shopping cart because I like the separation it gives between the shop page and the user's cart. I also like how it can be in the background if the user needs to add more items or keep browsing.
